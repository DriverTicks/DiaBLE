Experimenting with the Bluetooth BLE devices I bought for the Abbott FreeStyle Libre sensor (mainly  the Bubble and MiaoMiao transmitters, the M5Stack and the Watlaa watch) and trying something new compared to the traditional apps:

* a universal **SwiftUI** application for iPhone, iPad and Mac Catalyst;
* scanning the Libre directly via **NFC**;
* using online servers for calibrating just like **Abbottâ€™s algorithm**;
* varying the **reading interval** (the Bubble firmware allows to set it from 1 to 15 minutes while the MiaoMiao one to reduce it to 1 or 3 minutes);
* a detailed **log** to check the traffic from/to the BLE devices and remote servers.

Still too early to decide the final design (but I really like already the evil logo ðŸ˜ˆ), here there are the first rough screenshots:

The project started as a single script for the iPad Swift Playgrounds and was quickly converted to an app by using a standard Xcode template (the Core Data layer and the Watch Extension are not actually implemented): it should compile finely without dependencies just after changing the _Bundle Identifier_ in the _General_ panel and the _Team_ in the _Signing and Capabilities_ tab of Xcode (Spike users know already very well what that means... ;) ).

Please refer to the [TODOs list](https://github.com/gui-dos/DiaBLE/blob/master/TODO.md) for the up-to-date status of all the current limitations and known bugs of this prototype.
